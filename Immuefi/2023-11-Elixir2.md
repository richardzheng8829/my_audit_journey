# No validation check for `amountToReceive` to be equal with spot's amount when unqueuing.

## Bug Description
When withdrawing from perpertual market, it will add new spot into withdrawl queue.

Amount to withdraw will be subtracted from `tokenData.activeAmount`, `tokenData.userActiveAmount`.

It will cause serious issue like protocol insolvency, locking of user fund, if external sub account of particular router could send unqueue tx with `amountToReceive` different from spot's amount.

```
    function withdrawPerp(uint256 id, address token, uint256 amount) external whenWithdrawNotPaused nonReentrant {
      ...
        // Substract amount from the active market making balance of the caller.
        tokenData.userActiveAmount[msg.sender] -= amount;  

        // Substract amount from the active pool market making balance.
        tokenData.activeAmount -= amount;

        // Add to queue.
        queue[queueCount++] = Spot(msg.sender, id, pool.router, tokenToProduct[token], amount);

        emit Queued(queue[queueCount], queueCount, queueUpTo);
    } 

    function unqueue(uint128 spotId, uint256 amountToReceive) external {
        // Check that next spot in queue matches the given spot ID.
        if (spotId != queueUpTo + 1) revert InvalidSpot(spotId, queueUpTo);

        // Get the spot data from the queue.
        Spot memory spot = queue[queueUpTo];
```

## Impact
- User's fund will be locked if `amountToReceive` is smaller than spot's amount.

- Possible protocol insolvency if `amountToReceive` is greater than spot's amount.

- Withdrawal will be cancelled if `amountToReceive` is smaller than `withdrawlFee`.

## Recommendation
```
    function unqueue(uint128 spotId, uint256 amountToReceive) external {
        // Check that next spot in queue matches the given spot ID.
        if (spotId != queueUpTo + 1) revert InvalidSpot(spotId, queueUpTo);

        // Get the spot data from the queue.
        Spot memory spot = queue[queueUpTo];
+       if (amountToReceive != spot.amount) revert InvalidSpotAmount(spotId, spot.amount, amountToReceive);
```

## Proof of Concept
```
contract ContractTest is Test {
  function setUp() public {
    vm.createSelectFork("arbitrum"); 
  }

  function testElixirUnqueue() public {
    console.log("Deposit perp");
    manager.depositPerp(2, address(BTC), amountBTC, address(this));

    console.log("Withdraw perp");
    manager.withdrawPerp(2, address(BTC), amountBTC);

    console.log("Unqueue");
    vm.startPrank(address(uint160(uint256(VertexRouter(btcPerpRouter).externalSubaccount()))));
    manager.unqueue(manager.queueUpTo() + 1, amountBTC / 2);
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
}
