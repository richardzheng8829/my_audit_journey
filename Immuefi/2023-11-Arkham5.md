# `approveSubmission()` should not be called more than once, otherwise rewards could be sent again. 

## Bug Description

Offchain-calcuated parameter `n` denotes number of submissions to reject, which might be misleading because of transaction ordering dependence.

Let's say off-chain approver calls for txs

- rejectSubmissions(2)
- approveSubmissions()

- approveSubmission()
- rejectSubmission(2)

Winner will realize s

If `BountyV2.approveSubmission` tx is found, one can use raw `BountyV2.submission` parameter to make submission with payload as `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(submission, msg.sender))`.

## Impact
Malicious actors like hacker or rogue validator can win bounty unfairly if prior submissions are all to be rejected.

## Recommendation
1) `BountyV2.approveSubmission()` should approve submission made only prior to current block number.

Every submission should be recorded with `block.number` at which block submission was made.

```
    struct Submission {
        bytes32 payload;
        address submitter;
        uint256 stake;
+       uint256 blockNumber;
    }

    function makeSubmission(uint256 bounty, bytes32 payload) external {
        _submissions[bounty].push(Submission({
            payload: payload,
            submitter: _msgSender(),
            stake: _submissionStake
+           blockNumber: block.number
        }));

    function approveSubmissionAt(uint256 bounty, uint32 index) internal {
        require(_submissions[bounty][index].submitter != _msgSender(), "BountyV2: cannot approve own submission");
+       require(_submissions[bounty][index].blockNumber < block.number, "BountyV2: cannot later block number");

```

2) Commit-Reveal scheme can be used.

At commit phase, approve will reveal hash of submission only, and at reveal phase, approver will reveal actual submission.

At reveal phase, making submission should be blocked.

```
    mapping (uint256=>uint256) private sealedApprovals;

    function makeSubmission(uint256 bounty, bytes32 payload) external {
        require(sealedApprovals[bounty]==bytes(0), "Unable to make submission at reveal phase");
        ...
    }

    function commitApproval(uint256 bounty, bytes32 sealedApproval) onlyApprover external {
        sealedApprovals[bounty] = sealedApproval;
    }

    function revealApproval(uint256 bounty, bytes32 submission) onlyApprover external {
        require (sealedApprovals[bounty] == keccak256(bounty, submission), "Wrong hash");
        
        approveSubmission(bounty, submission);
        ...
    }

```
