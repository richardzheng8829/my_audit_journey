# CJPY holders are unable to redeem CJPY at will because of shortage of redeemable amount. CJPY will de-peg significantly in ETH bull market environment. Only MEV bot will profit from depegging.

## Bug Description
To maintain peg-stability, efficient redemption mechanism should be in place, any CJPY holder should be able to redeem with equal amount of ETH collateral at will.

Unlike typical CDP-based stablecoins like DAI, LUSD, eUSD. USDM, etc, only pledges with ICR < 130% are eligible for redemption.

```
        vars._checkpoint =
            vars._mcrPercent +
            IYamatoV3(yamato()).CHECKPOINT_BUFFER();

        while (true) {
            address _pledgeAddr = _prv6.rankedQueuePop(vars._nextICR);

            if (vars._nextICR >= vars._checkpoint) {
                // Note: This case conditioned as
                //       vars._activePledgeLength - vars._count == 0 || vars._nextICR >= vars._checkpoint
                //       but removed the first clause for simplicity.
                //       It would cause worse gas consumption in pledge-lacking cases but it's okay.
                break; /* inf loop checker */
            }

```

It means there's always shortage of supply of redeemable amount.

With current setting of TCR almost 300%, `IPriorityRegistry.getRedeemableAmount()` will always returns zero.

Even though there's any redeemable pledge available for a while, it will not be enough to achieve price stability and only benefit MEV bots.

Whenever there's any pledges available to redeem, bots will backrun ETH/USD or JPY/USD Chainlink price update with its redeem and swap tx.

After that, `IPriorityRegistry.getRedeemableAmount()` will be zero again and CJPY holder will be given no opportunity to redeem.

## Impact
CJPY holders are unable to redeem CJPY at will.

CJPY will de-peg significantly in ETH bull market environment which is reality now.

MEV bot will profit from de-pegging of CJPY token.

## Recommendation
Please enable redemption from riskiest pledges no matter of its ICR, just like other stablecoins with stable redemption mechanism.

## Proof of Concept
```
pragma solidity 0.8.10;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20Metadata.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

interface IYamato {
  function priorityRegistry() external view returns (address);
}

interface IPriorityRegistry {
  function getRedeemablesCap() external view returns (uint256 _cap);
}

contract ContractTest is Test {
  IYamato                 constant YMT = IYamato(0x02Fe72b2E9fF717EbF3049333B184E9Cd984f257);

  function setUp() public {
    vm.createSelectFork("mainnet"); 
  }

  function testYMT() public {
    IPriorityRegistry  registry = IPriorityRegistry(YMT.priorityRegistry());
    emit log_named_decimal_uint("Redeemable Cap", registry.getRedeemablesCap(), 18);
  }
}
```

### Output
forge test --match-test YMT -vvv
```
[PASS] testYMT() (gas: 2094620)
