# Uniswap TWAP oracle on L2s are vulnerable to potential oracle price manipulation, It should switch to Chainlink price feed.

## Bug Description
It is important to note that Uniswap advises against using their oracle on L2 networks, including Optimism and Arbitrum, due to the ease of manipulating price feeds in these environments. Therefore, it is recommended to refrain from utilizing Uniswap's oracle feature on Arbitrum until further updates or improvements are made to enhance oracle security.

The information provided by the Uniswap team(https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/oracle#oracles-integrations-on-layer-2-rollups), as documented in the Uniswap Oracle Integration on Layer 2 Rollups guide, primarily addresses the integration of Uniswap oracle on L2 Optimism. However, it is relevant to note that the same concerns apply to Arbitrum as well. Arbitrum's average block time is approximately 0.25 seconds, making it vulnerable to potential oracle price manipulation.

```
On Optimism, every transaction is confirmed as an individual block. The block.timestamp of these blocks, however, reflect the block.timestamp of the last L1 block ingested by the Sequencer. For this reason, Uniswap pools on Optimism are not suitable for providing oracle prices, as this high-latency block.timestamp update process makes the oracle much less costly to manipulate. In the future, it's possible that the Optimism block.timestamp will have much higher granularity (with a small trust assumption in the Sequencer), or that forced inclusion transactions will improve oracle security. For more information on these potential upcoming changes, please see the Optimistic Specs repo. For the time being, usage of the oracle feature on Optimism should be avoided.

Rebalancing relies on Uniswap oracle to check if price is within deviation range.

```solidity
    function checkCanRebalance() public view override {
        ...

        // check price near twap
        int24 twap = getTwap();
        int24 twapDeviation = tick > twap ? tick - twap : twap - tick;
        require(twapDeviation <= maxTwapDeviation, "TP");

        ...
    }
```
https://github.com/charmfinance/alpha-vaults-v2-contracts/blob/main/contracts/AlphaProVault.sol#L488-L496
```solidity
    function getTwap() public view returns (int24) {
        uint32 _twapDuration = twapDuration;
        uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
        secondsAgo[0] = _twapDuration;
        secondsAgo[1] = 0;

        (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = pool.observe(secondsAgo);
        return int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / _twapDuration);
    }
```
Recently several L2-based projects relieing on Uniswap oracle get hacked because of price manipulation.

## Impact
This manipulation can lead to delay or DoS in rebalancing operation.

## Recommendation
Until further updates or improvements are made to address the security concerns associated with Uniswap's oracle on Arbitrum, it is strongly recommended to refrain from utilizing the oracle feature in the current implementation.

It should switch to Chainlink data feed.
