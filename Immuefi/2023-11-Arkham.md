# Bounty winner will not receive late submitter's stake, and it will create tendency to become late-submitter.

Submissions being made after successful submission are refunded to submitter, but submissions being made before successful submission are sent to winners. 

## Bug Description

`BountyV2.approveSubmission()` will traverse all submissions to find valid one.

Before submission is found, it gets rejected.

After submission is found, it gets refunded to submitters. 

It means winner will only get sum of submissions stakes made prior to his submission.

    function approveSubmission(uint256 bounty, uint256 submission) external onlyApprover {

        bool _foundSubmission = false;

        for (uint32 i = _bounties[bounty].queueIndex; i < submissionsCount(bounty); i++) {
            // If we've already approved, refund stake.
            if (_foundSubmission) {
                SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(_arkm), _submissions[bounty][i].submitter, _submissions[bounty][i].stake);
            }

            // If this address hashes with the submission ID to produce this payload, it is the
            // target.
            else if (_submissions[bounty][i].payload == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(submission, _submissions[bounty][i].submitter))) {
                _foundSubmission = true;
                approveSubmissionAt(bounty, i);
            }

            //
            else {
                rejectSubmission(bounty);
            }
        }

        require(_foundSubmission, "BountyV2: submission not found");
    }
```

## Impact
- Winner will not get submission stakes after his submission.

- There's no incentive to make early submitter but for late ones.

## Recommendation
`approveSubmission()` should be two-step process.

1) First step is to find winner.

2) Second step is to send prize to winner or refund stake to submitters.
