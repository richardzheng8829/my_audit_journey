# Reward rate might be diluted by `notifyRewardAmount()` with wrong timing and amount.

## Bug Description
The `stakerewardV2pool.notifyRewardAmount()` `stakerewardPoolOnArbi.notifyRewardAmount()`, `EUSDMiningIncentives.notifyRewardAmount()` receive new reward amount and extends the current reward end time to now + duration.

It rebases the currently remaining rewards + the new rewards (reward + leftover) over this new duration period.

This can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits.

https://github.com/LybraFinance/LybraV2/blob/main/contracts/lybra/miner/EUSDMiningIncentives.sol#L281-L297
```
    function notifyRewardAmount(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner updateReward(address(0)) {
        require(amount != 0, "amount = 0");
        if (block.timestamp >= finishAt) {
            rewardRatio = amount / duration;
        } else {
            uint256 remainingRewards = (finishAt - block.timestamp) * rewardRatio;
            rewardRatio = (amount + remainingRewards) / duration;
        }

        require(rewardRatio != 0, "reward ratio = 0");

        finishAt = block.timestamp + duration;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        emit NotifyRewardChanged(amount, block.timestamp);
    }
```

## Proof of Concept
Let's imagine the current rewardRate is 1000 / 5 days(duration).

After 1 day(20%) have passed, i.e., now = lastUpdateTime + 20% * rewardsDuration.

A owner might mistakenly notify the contract with a reward of 0: `notifyRewardAmount(0)`.

Then the new rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration = (0 + 800) / duration = 800 / duration.

The rewardRate just dropped by 20%.

This can be repeated infinitely.

After another 20% of reward time passed, they trigger notifyRewardAmount(0) to reduce it by another 20% again:

rewardRate = (0 + 640) / duration = 640 / duration.

## Impact
This would cause loss of yield for all depositors, if `notifyRewardAmount()` is called with wrongly selected time and amount.

## Recommendation
`rewardRate` should never decrease by a `notifyRewardAmount()` call.

There should be check if reward rate is bigger that before notification.

```
    function notifyRewardAmount(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner updateReward(address(0)) {
        require(amount != 0, "amount = 0");

        uint256 prevRewardRate = rewardRatio;

        if (block.timestamp >= finishAt) {
            rewardRatio = amount / duration;
        } else {
            uint256 remainingRewards = (finishAt - block.timestamp) * rewardRatio;
            rewardRatio = (amount + remainingRewards) / duration;
        }

-       require(rewardRatio != 0, "reward ratio = 0");
+       require(rewardRatio > prevRewardRate, "reward ratio diluted");

        finishAt = block.timestamp + duration;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        emit NotifyRewardChanged(amount, block.timestamp);
    }
```

    }
    

    function testReward() public {
        emit log_named_decimal_uint("Pre-notification reward rate", miningIncentive.rewardRatio(), 18);

        vm.startPrank(miningIncentive.owner());
        miningIncentive.notifyRewardAmount(0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        emit log_named_decimal_uint("Post-notification reward rate", miningIncentive.rewardRatio(), 18);
    }
}
