# Possible race condition in distribution. Same contest can be distributed by owner and organizer by signature if contest is expired.

## Summary

Signature has been signed before expiration date, but relayer submitted it after expiraton date.

But owner has already distributed prize, so organizer's prize decision is ignored.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
    function deployProxyAndDistributeBySignature(
        address organizer,
        bytes32 contestId,
        address implementation,
        bytes calldata signature,
        bytes calldata data
    ) public returns (address) {
        bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(contestId, data)));
        if (ECDSA.recover(digest, signature) != organizer) revert ProxyFactory__InvalidSignature();
        bytes32 salt = _calculateSalt(organizer, contestId, implementation);
        if (saltToCloseTime[salt] == 0) revert ProxyFactory__ContestIsNotRegistered();
        if (saltToCloseTime[salt] > block.timestamp) revert ProxyFactory__ContestIsNotClosed();
        address proxy = _deployProxy(organizer, contestId, implementation);
        _distribute(proxy, data);
        return proxy;
    }
```

## Impact
Race condition between owner and organizer.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Should lock prize money for fixed period after distribution.

During that time, organizer should be able to override owner's decision.
