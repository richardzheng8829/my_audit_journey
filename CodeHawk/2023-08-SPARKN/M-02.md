# Blacklisted winner will block the other winners prize.

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-08-sparkn/blob/main/src/Distributor.sol#L147

## Summary
`Distributor._distribute()` will distribute prize to winners.

If any of the transfer fails, e.g USDC blacklisting, a whole transaction will revert.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
        uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
        for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) {
            uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
            erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount); // @audit - any of the winner is blacklisted.
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

## Impact
DoS of Prize distribution

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Should have claim() function where winners can withdraw their prize.

```solidity
+   mapping(address => uint256) public prize;
+   IERC20 public prizeToken;

+   function claimPrize() external {
+       uint256 amount = prize[msg.sender];
+       if (amount > 0)
+       {
+           delete prize[msg.sender];
+           prizeToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
+       }
+   }
```

```solidity
+       prizeToken = erc20;
        uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
        for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) {
            uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
-           erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount); // @audit - any of the winner is blacklisted.
+           prize[winners[i]] = amount;
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
