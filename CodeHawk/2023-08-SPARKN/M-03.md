# Unbounded loop might cause gas griefing because of long winners.length

Medium

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-08-sparkn/blob/main/src/Distributor.sol#L144-L151

## Summary
`Distributor._distribute()` will distribute prize to winners.

If winners.length is long, gas griefing in loop is possible.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
        uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
        for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) { // @audit - unbounded gas consumption
            uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
            erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount); 
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

## Impact
DoS of Prize distribution

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Should have maximum limit for winner length.


```solidity
        uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
+       require(winnersLength <= MAX_WINNERS_LENGTH, Distributor__WinnersLengthReched());
            
        for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) {
            uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
            erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount); // @audit - any of the winner is blacklisted.
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
