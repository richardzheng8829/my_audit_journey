# A user can self-liquidate to get liquidation reward. Self-liquidation should not be allowed.

## Summary

`DSCEngine.liquidate()` does not check if `user` is same as `msg.sender`.

A user can mint more stablecoin to make his position liquiditable then call `liquidate()`.

## Proof of Concept 
https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-foundry-defi-stablecoin/blob/main/src/DSCEngine.sol#L229-L238
```solidity
    function liquidate(address collateral, address user, uint256 debtToCover)
        external
        moreThanZero(debtToCover)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // need to check health factor of the user
        uint256 startingUserHealthFactor = _healthFactor(user);
        if (startingUserHealthFactor >= MIN_HEALTH_FACTOR) {
            revert DSCEngine__HealthFactorOk();
        } // @audit - it does not check it's self-liquidation.
```

## Impact
Self-liquidation will get user addition liquidation reward rather than repaying and redeeming collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`DSCEngine.liquidate()` should revert if `msg.sender` is same as `user`.

    {
        // need to check health factor of the user
        uint256 startingUserHealthFactor = _healthFactor(user);
        if (startingUserHealthFactor >= MIN_HEALTH_FACTOR) {
            revert DSCEngine__HealthFactorOk();
        } 
+       require(msg.sender != user, DSCEngine_SelfLiquidaton);
```
