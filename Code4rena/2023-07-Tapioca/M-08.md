## Summary
`BigBang.totalFees` variable is always zero and never increased outside `refreshPenroseFees`. e.g USDO minting event does not increase `totalFee` variable.

## Severity

Medium

## Proof of Concept 
There's no instance where `totalFee` is increased outside `refreshPenroseFees()`. 

e.g USDO minting at `_borrow()` does not increase `totalFee` variable.

It means `totalFee` will be always 0 when `refreshPenroseFees` is called and there's no need for this storage variable.

```solidity
    function refreshPenroseFees(
        address
    ) external onlyOwner notPaused returns (uint256 feeShares) {
        uint256 balance = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        totalFees += balance;
        feeShares = yieldBox.toShare(assetId, totalFees, false);

        if (totalFees > 0) {
            asset.approve(address(yieldBox), totalFees);

            yieldBox.depositAsset(
                assetId,
                address(this),
                msg.sender,
                totalFees,
                0
            );

            totalFees = 0;
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
There could be 2 resolution for this issue.

- `totalFee` variable should be removed if there's no need to collect fee at `BigBang.sol`.
- Should relevantly increased in the instances like _borrow().
