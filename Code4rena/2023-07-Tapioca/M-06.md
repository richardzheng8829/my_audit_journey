## Summary
Withdrawal from Yearn strategy might be blocked if there's any loss in the vault, as `maxLoss` parameter is zero.

It is quite possible for some times Yearn strategy might return incurring losses.

`YearnStrategy._withdraw()` does not tolerate any losses incurred. It will make withdrawal from Yearn strategies blocked.

## Proof of Concept

It is quite possible for some times Yearn strategy might return incurring losses.

`YearnStrategy._withdraw()` does not tolerate any losses incurred. It will make withdrawal from Yearn strategies blocked.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal override nonReentrant {
        uint256 available = _currentBalance();
        require(available >= amount, "YearnStrategy: amount not valid");

        uint256 queued = wrappedNative.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount > queued) {
            uint256 pricePerShare = vault.pricePerShare();
            uint256 toWithdraw = (((amount - queued) *
                (10 ** vault.decimals())) / pricePerShare);

            vault.withdraw(toWithdraw, address(this), 0); // @audit - maxLoss = 0
        }
        wrappedNative.safeTransfer(to, amount - 1); //rounding error

        emit AmountWithdrawn(to, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
It should use `maxLoss` parameter which is updatable by owner.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal override nonReentrant {
        uint256 available = _currentBalance();
        require(available >= amount, "YearnStrategy: amount not valid");

        uint256 queued = wrappedNative.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount > queued) {
            uint256 pricePerShare = vault.pricePerShare();
            uint256 toWithdraw = (((amount - queued) *
                (10 ** vault.decimals())) / pricePerShare);

-           vault.withdraw(toWithdraw, address(this), maxLoss);
+           vault.withdraw(toWithdraw, address(this), maxLoss);
        }
        wrappedNative.safeTransfer(to, amount - 1); //rounding error

        emit AmountWithdrawn(to, amount);
    }
```
