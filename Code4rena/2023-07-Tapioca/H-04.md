## Summary
Pool's average magnitude is wrongly calculated in case of new participant addition. Should be `(pool's cumulative magnitude + new magnitude) / particpants`.

## Severity

High

## Proof of Concept 
Every time new twTAP participant is joing a pool, new magnitude for twTAP holder is computed by `computeMagnitude`.

It will update pool's cumulative and average magnitude.

As average magnitude should be mathematical average of all participant's magnitude, it should be updated as following.

- `new pool's cumulative magnitude` = `(old pool's cumulative magnitude + new magnitude)`;
- `new pool's average magnitude` = `new pool's cumulative magnitude` / participants;

But implementation is different.

```solidity
            pool.totalParticipants++; // Save participation
            pool.averageMagnitude =
                (pool.averageMagnitude + magnitude) /
                pool.totalParticipants; // compute new average magnitude 
                // @audit - wrong calculation of average, should be pool.cumulative
```

## Impact
Pool's average magnitude will get smaller and smaller as the number of participants grows. It will affect twTAP price.

## Recommendation
Should replace `pool.averageMagnitude + magnitude` with `pool.averageMagnitude + magnitude`.

```solidity
            pool.totalParticipants++; // Save participation
            pool.averageMagnitude =
-               (pool.averageMagnitude + magnitude) /
+               (pool.cumulative + magnitude) /
                pool.totalParticipants; // compute new average magnitude 
                // @audit - wrong calculation of average, should be pool.cumulative
```
