## Summary

Unneeded `payable` modifier for TemplateV1.initialize().

## Severity

Medium

## Proof of Concept
https://github.com/DeFiGeek-Community/yamawake/blob/main/contracts/TemplateV1.sol#L37-L51
```solidity
    function initialize(
        address owner_,
        uint256 startingAt_,
        uint256 eventDuration_,
        address token_,
        uint256 allocatedAmount_,
        uint256 minRaisedAmount_
    ) external payable onlyFactory returns (address, uint256) { // @audit - unnecessary payable modifier as creation fee is not accepted.
        require(!initialized, "This contract has already been initialized");
        initialized = true;

        require(
            msg.value == 0,
            "This contract does not accept the creation fee"
        );

```

## Impact
Denial of Service
As there's no minimum bidding amount ratio or time limit as compared to previous bid, a malicious actor can block any bid to be made easily.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Thers should be minimum bidding amount ratio or time limit as compared to previous bid.
