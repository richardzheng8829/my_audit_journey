## Summary

LP might not receive eligible reward because of precision loss.

## Severity

High

## Proof of Concept 

It may be wrong assumption that `IProtocolShareReserve.getUnreleasedFunds()` will only increase as time goes by.

When this assumption is not enforced, `Prime.accrueInterest()` will revert.

```
            if (overallInRangeLiquidity > 0) {
                uint256 inRangeLiquidityOfPosition;
                for (int24 j = lowerTick + 10; j <= upperTick - 10; ++j) {
                    inRangeLiquidityOfPosition += timeWeightedWeeklyPositionInRangeConcLiquidity_[poolIdx][posKey][week][j];
                }
                // Percentage of this weeks overall in range liquidity that was provided by the user times the overall weekly rewards
                rewardsToSend += inRangeLiquidityOfPosition * concRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][week] / overallInRangeLiquidity;
            }
            concLiquidityRewardsClaimed_[poolIdx][posKey][week] = true;
```


## Impact
LP might not receive eligible reward because of precision loss.

## Recommendation
Should multiply and divide by constant multiplier to avoid precision loss.

```
+    uint256 public constant MULTIPLIER = 10000;

    function claimConcentratedRewards(
        address payable owner,
        bytes32 poolIdx,
        int24 lowerTick,
        int24 upperTick,
        uint32[] memory weeksToClaim
    ) internal {
        ...


-    rewardsToSend += inRangeLiquidityOfPosition * concRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][week] / overallInRangeLiquidity;
+    rewardsToSend += inRangeLiquidityOfPosition * concRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][week] * MULTIPLIER / overallInRangeLiquidity;

...
-            (bool sent, ) = owner.call{value: rewardsToSend}("");
+            (bool sent, ) = owner.call{value: rewardsToSend / MULTIPLIER }("");

```
