## Summary

Deposit and borrowing APR will be zero for first-time users given market.

## Severity

High

## Proof of Concept
`Prime.calculateAPR()` will be used to calculate APR for given market and user.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-venus/blob/main/contracts/Tokens/Prime/Prime.sol#L496-L515
```solidity
    function calculateAPR(address market, address user) external view returns (uint256 supplyAPR, uint256 borrowAPR) {
        IVToken vToken = IVToken(market);
        uint256 borrow = vToken.borrowBalanceStored(user);
        uint256 exchangeRate = vToken.exchangeRateStored();
        uint256 balanceOfAccount = vToken.balanceOf(user);
        uint256 supply = (exchangeRate * balanceOfAccount) / EXP_SCALE;
        ...

        return _calculateUserAPR(market, supply, borrow, cappedSupply, cappedBorrow, userScore, totalScore);
    }
```

But if user does not have any prior deposit or borrow, `_calculateUserAPR()` will return zero.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-venus/blob/main/contracts/Tokens/Prime/Prime.sol#L1012-L1013
```
    function _calculateUserAPR(
        address vToken,
        uint256 totalSupply,
        uint256 totalBorrow,
        uint256 totalCappedSupply,
        uint256 totalCappedBorrow,
        uint256 userScore,
        uint256 totalScore
    ) internal view returns (uint256 supplyAPR, uint256 borrowAPR) {
        ...

        supplyAPR = totalSupply == 0 ? 0 : ((userSupplyIncomeYearly * MAXIMUM_BPS) / totalSupply);
        borrowAPR = totalBorrow == 0 ? 0 : ((userBorrowIncomeYearly * MAXIMUM_BPS) / totalBorrow);
```

## Impact
If user has borrowed for the first time in given market, he can borrow funds with no interest.
If user has deposited for the first time in given market, he may not get any interest from hist deposit.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should return based APR when deposit and borrow amount is zero.
