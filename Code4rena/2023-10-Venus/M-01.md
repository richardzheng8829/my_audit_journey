## Summary

`Prime.accrueInterest()` will revert if `IProtocolShareReserve.getUnreleasedFunds()` has decreased than before.

## Severity

High

## Proof of Concept 

It may be wrong assumption that `IProtocolShareReserve.getUnreleasedFunds()` will only increase as time goes by.

When this assumption is not enforced, `Prime.accrueInterest()` will revert.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-venus/blob/main/contracts/Tokens/Prime/Prime.sol#L561-L580
```
        uint256 totalIncomeUnreleased = IProtocolShareReserve(protocolShareReserve).getUnreleasedFunds(
            comptroller,
            IProtocolShareReserve.Schema.SPREAD_PRIME_CORE,
            address(this),
            underlying
        );

        // @audit - Wrong assumption that IProtocolShareReserve(protocolShareReserve).getUnreleasedFunds will only increase with time.
        uint256 distributionIncome = totalIncomeUnreleased - unreleasedPSRIncome[underlying];

        ...
        unreleasedPSRIncome[underlying] = totalIncomeUnreleased;
```

There's no formal implementation of `IProtocolShareReserve` only mock one.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-venus/blob/main/contracts/test/MockProtocolShareReserve.sol#L318-L335
```
    function getUnreleasedFunds(
        address comptroller,
        Schema schema,
        address destination,
        address asset
    ) external view returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < distributionTargets.length; ) {
            DistributionConfig storage _config = distributionTargets[i];
            if (_config.schema == schema && _config.destination == destination) {
                uint256 total = assetsReserves[comptroller][asset][schema];
                return (total * _config.percentage) / MAX_PERCENT;
            }

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

If distribution config's percentage is changed, it may decrease as time increases.


## Impact
`Prime.updateScores()`, `Prime.xvsUpdated()` will revert, too.

It means major operation of Prime will be DoSed.

## Recommendation
Should check if underflow occurs, if so, it should gracefully return.

```
        uint256 totalIncomeUnreleased = IProtocolShareReserve(protocolShareReserve).getUnreleasedFunds(
            comptroller,
            IProtocolShareReserve.Schema.SPREAD_PRIME_CORE,
            address(this),
            underlying
        );

+       if (totalIncomeUnreleased < unreleasedPSRIncome[underlying])
+           return;
        uint256 distributionIncome = totalIncomeUnreleased - unreleasedPSRIncome[underlying];

        ...
        unreleasedPSRIncome[underlying] = totalIncomeUnreleased;
```
